# CityPop - An application for viewing population size
This application lets you either search for a city or country. When searching for a city, you will see the population size directly on a new screen. When searching for a country, a window displaying three cities in population order will appear. Clicking on one of the cities will lead you to a new screen displaying the population size for that city. You can easily return to the home page by clicking the "CITYPOP" logo on the top left corner.

The application is build upon an API from Geonames.
